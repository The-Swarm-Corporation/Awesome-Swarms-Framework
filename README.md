## Why Swarms? üöÄ

Swarms isn't just another agent framework; it's a production-grade multi-agent infrastructure platform designed for reliability, scalability, and state-of-the-art performance.

  * **ü§ñ Collective Intelligence:** Move beyond the limitations of single agents. Swarms enable multiple specialized agents to collaborate, reason, and solve complex, multi-faceted problems that are impossible for a single agent to tackle.
  * **üß± Advanced Modular Structures:** Swarms provides a rich set of pre-built, battle-tested agent formations (Structures) like **Concurrent Swarms**, **Hierarchical Swarms**, **Mixture-of-Agents**, and **Agent Councils**. Build sophisticated workflows with minimal code.
  * **üî¨ Research-Backed:** Implementations are directly inspired by and often surpass state-of-the-art academic research. Swarms bridges the gap between theoretical papers and production-ready applications.
  * **üõ†Ô∏è Rich Tooling & Integrations:** A massive ecosystem of tools, from web Browse and code execution to vector databases and third-party framework integrations (LangChain, AutoGen), is available out of the box.
  * **üåê Real-World Applications:** From automated financial analysis and medical diagnosis to complex scientific research and secure code generation, Swarms provides templates and examples for a vast array of industries.
  * **‚úÖ Reliability & Scalability:** Built with production in mind, Swarms includes features for error handling, concurrent processing, load balancing, and monitoring to ensure your agent systems are robust and efficient.

## üí° Core Concepts

To get the most out of Swarms, it's helpful to understand a few key concepts:

  * **Agent:** The fundamental building block. An autonomous entity that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and execute tasks. In Swarms, an `Agent` is typically powered by an LLM and can be equipped with tools.
  * **Swarm:** A collection of agents organized into a specific structure to collaborate on a common goal. The Swarm orchestrates the flow of information and tasks between its constituent agents.
  * **Structure:** The architecture or topology of a Swarm. This defines how agents communicate and collaborate. Examples include `HierarchicalSwarm` (for top-down command), `ConcurrentSwarm` (for parallel processing), and `GroupChat` (for interactive sessions).
  * **Tool:** A function or utility that an agent can use to interact with the outside world, such as searching the web, running code, or accessing a database.
  * **Workflow:** A sequence or graph of tasks executed by one or more agents. Swarms allows you to define simple sequential workflows or complex, dynamic graphs of operations.
  * **Multi-modality:** The ability for agents to process and understand information beyond just text, including images, audio, and video.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Getting started with Swarms is incredibly simple.

**1. Installation**
Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install swarms
```

**2. Your First "Hello, Swarm\!"**
This simple example demonstrates the basic `Agent` class.

```python
from swarms import Agent, OpenAIChat

# Get your API key from https://openai.com/
api_key = "..."

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
)

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,

    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=True
)

# Run the agent with a task
out = agent("What is the capital of France? Respond in a single word.")
print(out) # Output: Paris
```
